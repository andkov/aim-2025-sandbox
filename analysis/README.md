# `./analysis/` Directory

Contains reproducible reports narrating the engagement with the data of choice

# Rules

1.  A folder contains a monothematic engagement with an Analysis-Ready Rectangle

2.  Until it can be rendered into a report, a script is but a scratch pad.

3.  If you want a report to exist for the public - add a link in this README.
