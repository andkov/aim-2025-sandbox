This file defines the foundational logic, constraints, and epistemological commitments of the analytic project.

In a human–AI creative symbiosis, the human serves not merely as an operator, but as a **philosopher–scientist**—the conductor of meaning. Their role is to define the framework within which the AI can execute and translate, but not originate, analytic purpose.

Investigate and understand publishing trends in Ukraine since 2005. 

Understand and describe regional difference (difference based on geography).

### Technical Aims

A collection of reproducible scripted reports (e.g. .R, .qmd) that explore, analyze, and visualize the data, with clear documentation of methods and findings.


### Specific Deliverables

a set of EDA reports that explore the data from multiple angles, including temporal trends, regional differences, and language use patterns.
