## Measures

The data of the Book Chamber of Ukraine (BCU) use two indicators: "number of titles" (title_count) and "circulation" (copy_count).

First of all, "number of titles" and "circulation" (which is the same as "print run"). In publishing, a "title" means a specific edition that has a unique name, volume, design, and other characteristics. Simply put, the number of titles counts the book names. For example, if the publisher "John Doe" released three books last year titled "A", "B", and "C", then the number of titles in this case would be 3. If we add the information that book "A" was published in 100 copies, "B" — 300 copies, and "C" — 600 copies, we get a total circulation = 1000. Thus, circulation is the number of copies of a single book released at one time.

## Types of Publications (purpose)
The State Standard of Ukraine (DSTU) from 2015 defines 14 types of publications. They are determined by volume, type of information, production method, language feature, etc. The Book Chamber provides information about the type by its intended purpose, each subdivision of which indicates the aim of the publication and its audience.

## Language of Publication
The distribution by language of publication until 2018 contains information only about Ukrainian and Russian languages; from 2018 to 2024, data on various world languages are available.
